sophia is bad at updating radhika about very important things

you know, this gets me thinking, i've told you for literally 4 months now you can use me for stuff and here we are, with you only asking me for help once, and in that case i basically had to extend myself to help because you didn't actually expect me to get it

i don't know if you're just not a fan of mixing the professional and the persona

adding another line because PERMISSIONS
